Signal Bleed (AP/HotSpot Attacks) 
Wireless signals frequently propagate outside organizational boundaries, allowing adversaries to monitor or gain unauthorized access to the wireless network. Organizations should implement measures to detect, understand, and reduce unnecessary RF propagation to minimize this threat. 

Reduce the range of RF communications to their intended operating range when possible. Propagation reduction methods may include: 
Reducing transmission power on wireless signals.
Adjusting antenna gain to prevent extensions beyond organizational boundaries.
Employing RF shielding techniques to block excessive signal propagation.

Tools to Use:
Wifi-analyzer
Itâ€™s worth noting that dBm values range from -30dBm (excellent signal strength) to -100dBm (very weak signal). Ideally, you want your WiFi signal strength to be above -70dBm for optimal performance.
